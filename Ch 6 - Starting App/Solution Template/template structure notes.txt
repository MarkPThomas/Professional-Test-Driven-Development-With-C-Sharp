docs & db generally shouldn't be created unless absolutely necessary. Resist creating these or any more folders, because a proliferation of folders is a sign of bad application development habits.

In the src folder, create a blank solution, then create projects within this folder, starting with:
[SolutionName].Core = Main backend project, such as a class library.
[SolutionName].UnitTests
[SolutionName].IntegrationTests

For each additional project, create corresponding folders within each of the testing projects.

In the demo solution are the following: 
Core = Class Library
ExternalServices = ASP.Net MVC Framework
WebClient = WCF Framework
WinClient = WPF Framework
